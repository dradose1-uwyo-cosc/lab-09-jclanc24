## Worked with/sources 
* Light debugging use of chat gpt:  example queries were trouble shooting why certain lines of codes were not executing and explaining attribute errors
* if __name__ == "__main__": and main () lines taken from example code using chat gpt while debugging
* decided to leave the lines in program since shorted code and provided another way to quit the program besides using quit()
* example
## Project Quirks/ Things that don't work
* self must be called within every attribute defined within a class
* objects of pizza must be defined inside the pizzeria class and in main() - each requries its own line of code
* *toppings allows multiple types of variables to be passed
